# Iris_Species_Matplotlib_All_In_One:v:
* This is one of the classical Kaggle Problem available for the newbie so that they can learn the basic of the Data Science and Machine Learning.
* I had tried to implement all the different kinds of the visualisation which can be done on it.


## Getting Started
* First Download the Dataset from the repo.
* Clone the **repo**.
* Go to the File and run the .py file through cmd with python3 as the default python version/virtual_environment could also be used in it.

## Learning:
* You can get upto the intermediate knowledge of the MATPLOTLIB and Seborn.
* Good for the data visualisation part.

### Technologies:
* Programming Language: Python3
* Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Prerequisites
Pre install all the dependencies before cloning the repo
```
pip install python3 seaborn matplotlib numpy plotly
```
You should already need to have all the dependencies installed already.:boom:

## Built With 

* [VisualStudio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Best Editor for the Code Writing and Debugging
* [Python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) - All the dependecy are used on Python3
* [**Kaggle For Iris Species**l](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction) -You can refer to the more links.

## References or Credits:

* Kaggle is one of the most important platform for getting more deeper into data Science.
* From the  [**Biphili**](https://www.kaggle.com/mjbahmani/santander-ml-explainability) Sir Kernel, I had learnt a lot from his kernel for the Seaborn and Matplotlib.
* **Tribute.txt** is basically the file in which I always give the link regarding the kernel. Go and See their kernel for the more indepth knowledge.
